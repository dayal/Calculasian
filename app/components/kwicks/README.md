## About Kwicks

Kwicks for jQuery is a plugin providing sexy sliding panels with an emphasis on navigational interaction. Kwicks was
originally a port of a MooTools effect (of the same name), but has since evolved into a highly configurable and versatile
UI component.

Kwicks is a fundamentally visual and interactive UI component, so the easiest way to understand what it is and how it 
works is to see it in action.  **Please check out the [kwicks homepage](http://devsmash.com/projects/kwicks) for the
documentation, examples, and help on getting started!**
